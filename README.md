# prolog-fdsets-enumeration
Main parts of the prolog code enumerating the different logically valid and closed sets of functional dependencies (part of my PhD thesis, 2007). Generation of the cases is based on the ST axiomatization and algorithm presented in the thesis. The case for 6 attributes is optimized separately as it exceeded the available computation resources with the original approach.
